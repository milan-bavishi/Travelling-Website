                    from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC,[4] with
                    selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China.

                    Little of the Qin wall remains.[5] Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple
                    stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty

                <p> Sigiriya or Sinhagiri is an ancient rock fortress located in the northern Matale District near the
                    town of Dambulla in the Central Province, Sri Lanka. It is a site of historical and archaeological
                    significance that is dominated by a massive column of granite rock approximately 180 m (590 ft)
                    high.
                    <br><br>
                    According to the ancient Sri Lankan chronicle the Cūḷavaṃsa, this area was a large forest, then
                    after storms and landslides it became a hill and was selected by King Kashyapa (AD 477–495) for his
                    new capital. He built his palace on top of this rock and decorated its sides with colourful
                    frescoes.
